Mega Multiplexer, port mutiplexer for shadowsocks, supports AEAD methods only.

### Intro

You can use mmp-go to reuse single port to forward to multiple shadowsocks servers.

It is suitable for relay servers with a limited number of ports.

Consider the following:

```bash
                                                   |------> SS Server1
Client --> Single Port --> Validator / Multiplexer |------> SS Server2
                                                   |------> SS Server3
```
